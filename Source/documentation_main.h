\section secMainContent Content description
In this project, we will develop a sophisticated training application during the live streams 
on the "adecc Scholar" Twitch channel. This application will serve as a foundation for future 
streams and diverse training sessions. In order to ensure the accessibility of these concepts 
to a wide audience, the resources will be shared along with an MIT license. It's important to 
note that specific functions within the application may carry distinct licenses.

This undertaking involves not only a shift in architectural approach to establish a more 
intricate program structure, but also an effective utilization of the linguistic capabilities 
offered by C++. This includes employing various programming paradigms. Consequently, our focus 
extends beyond mere class definitions. We will also delve into more intricate inheritance 
structures, a feature that can be exclusively leveraged within the C++ realm. Additionally, we 
will showcase the efficiency gained by implementing templates, leading to significant time savings.
